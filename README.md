# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description
I had to create a quiz that will test the user's javacript knowledge. This was by far the most challenging and time consuming assignment ive worked on and I was so content when the functions and game started to work. I added many variables, functions, booleans, objects, a local storage, and much more to it to make it work. I have learned so much from this assignment. Even though it was the most challenging, it was also the most rewarding because I was able to figure out why something wasnt working by googling or youtubing it. And little by little I was able to complete the assignment.
